        "q2": { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "What size clubs do these fit?", "answer": "<p>Drivers up to 460cc (which is most modern drivers), plus fairway woods and hybrids. More forgiving than your playing partners when you're looking for your ball in the rough.</p>" } },
        "q3": { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "How long does shipping take?", "answer": "<p>3-5 business days to major cities, 5-7 to rural areas. Still faster than that group ahead of you looking for balls on every hole.</p>" } },

        "q5": { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "Why is it called 'Topped It'?", "answer": "<p>Because every golfer has been there. That sickening thwack as you catch the top of the ball and it dribbles 30 metres. We named our brand after our worst shots so our customers don't have to hide from theirs.</p>" } },
        "q6": { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "Are these durable?", "answer": "<p>Premium synthetic leather with reinforced stitching. Built to survive being thrown into the boot after a bad round. We've all been there.</p>" } },
        "q7": { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "Can I buy just one cover?", "answer": "<p>Absolutely. R375 for The Mulligan (single). But The Scramble (3-pack) at R700 saves you R500 — that's at least 10 rounds of lost balls right there.</p>" } },
        "q8": { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "Do you do gift packaging?", "answer": "<p>Not yet, but it ships discreetly. Perfect for gifting to your group's 'most improved' player. (We all know what that means.)</p>" } },
        "q9": { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "What's your returns policy?", "answer": "<p>30 days, no drama. Just like that putt you missed — we'll pretend it didn't happen.</p>" } }
