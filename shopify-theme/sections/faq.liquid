        { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "Can I buy just one cover?", "answer": "<p>Absolutely. R375 for The Mulligan (single). But The Scramble (3-pack) at R700 saves you R500 — that's at least 10 rounds of lost balls right there.</p>" } },
        { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "Do you do gift packaging?", "answer": "<p>Not yet, but it ships discreetly. Perfect for gifting to your group's 'most improved' player. (We all know what that means.)</p>" } },
